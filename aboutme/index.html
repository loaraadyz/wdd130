    <p>Hi there! I am Loara but you can call me Lara. I am currently pursuing my second degree, BS in Professional Studies. 
        My first degree is BS in Electrical Engineering and is currently teaching my profession at one of the Universities 
        here in the Philippines. I wanted to learn more about technology and business that's why I decided to enroll here at 
        BYUi online. My chosen certificates are "Web and Computer Programming", "CAD", and "Business Leadership". 
        It was an open opportunity for me because I can still study while working. </p>
    <p>It was my husband who inspires me to study here at BYUi. We've been married for 2 years and I was blessed to witness
        how BYUi helps him learn and grow. We do not have children yet, but we are very hopeful for that blessing to come. 
        Since we have nothing to feed other than ourselves, we are spending our time and effort serving the Lord. We are 
        both magnifying our callings very well. He is serving as the Branch President of our branch and I am serving as the District
        Young Women President in our District.</p>
    <p>I am very much grateful that through BYUi online and PathwayConnect Program, I was able to fulfill one of my goals. 
        I was in my youth when I learned the importance of education. Most especially when I read about President Gordon B Hinckley's 
        passion for learning through his father's example. At the end of his message about his father, he stated 
        “… Why am I telling you of an old man and the wall on which he sat? I am telling you because I think it has a lesson for each of us. 
        We must never cease to learn. We believe in eternal progression and that this life is a part of eternity to be profitably lived until the very end.”</p>
    <p>The Lord is helping us to gain education in this life. I will never take for granted all of these opportunities. I hope that I would
        also be an instrument to inspire others to learn and grow.</p>
