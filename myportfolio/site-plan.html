        Hi! My name is Loara Adyz, I am from the Philippines. I am a Registered Electrical Engineer and a Registered Master Electrician here in my country. I am an Instuctor in Don Mariano Marcos Memorial State University teaching Mathematics, Sciences, and Electrical Engineering Subjects. I am also an Instructor in Brigham Young Universiry - PathwayConnect Program handling Professional Skills for the BYUPathway Students. My love for teaching came to me when I'd witness many individuals improved and changed while I was serving a full-time mission in the Island of Panay, Philippines. It became then my inspiration to teach more people for their own good. As soon as I graduated college, I was accepted by a company where I taught English as a Second Language to Chinese People until I received my liscense as an Electrical Engineer. I had then a strong desire to be an educator of my chosen profession. I was blessed of much opportunity to teach and inspire aspirant engineers and professionals. 

As of this time, I am expanding my effort to broaden my profession. Recently, I was accredited as a Safety Officer 2. I am also currently taking my second Bachelor's Degree focusing on Professional Studies. I am currently pursuing Web and Computer Programming, Computer-Aided Design and Drafting, and Business and Leadership Skills. My full purpose of heart, I am continually improving myself to be a blessing to the future generation.

Again, I am Engr. Loara. I am grateful to serve as an advocate of learning.
